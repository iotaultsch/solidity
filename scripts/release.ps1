# Sadly file globbing inside the PowerShell script didn't work (only on command line), so I had
# to do some Where-Object- & findstr-fu to achieve the same.
# Normally the prefix should be something like: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\*\VC\Redist\MSVC\*\x86\"
# that should only expand to a single path (unless you have multiple versions installed).
